To create a new instance of something:
create(Type, Name).
create(Type, Name, ID).
create(Type, Name, ID, Properties)

Type - the type of the object (for a generic object, 'object'). Can be abstract!
Name - the initial alias for the object; is what the object is initially referred to as.
ID - [Optional] a handle to refer to this specific object as.
Properties - [Optional] a list of properties of this object. Same as defining them all separately afterwards.

dig(Name)
dig(Name, ID)
dig(Name, ID, Properties)

Shortcuts for create/2, create/3, create/4 with Type=room.

After creating an object, it is the active_object until another object is created. Anything referred to without an explicit ID will be assumed to be the active object.
If an object is not a room, it is placed in the active room.




In all examples, the ID is the omitted first argument.

Properties of common objects:

description(Thing)

Gives the description of a thing when used with examine or look. If not given, uses the default for the given type.

alias(Thing, Aliases)

Adds aliases for a thing; things can also be called this. 

exit(Direction, Room2, ExitID)

Adds an exit to a room in a specific direction, leading to Room2. It is bidirectional. The ID can be used for assigning a door to this exit.
