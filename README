CatMUD is a MUD server (and MUD game) written in Prolog. 
It is not designed to be robust, nor widely used, so it's probably not going to stand up to a regular MUD environment.

Current Features (mostly just skeletal):
Object Model
Server
Parser

TODO:

Look into proper telnet protocols and mud protocols and stuff.
main loop!
